The Coin Change Problem-- Find the Mean and Standard Deviation of the Change

Question:
Suppose we need to make three transactions for 25 cents, one dollar, and ten dollar. There are 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents coins available for the transactions. Solve the mean and standard deviation of the changes for the three transactions. 

Language: python 3.0

Approach: 
1. Numerical approach is used to solve the mean and standard deviation of the change in the transaction of 25 cents. 2. Monte Carlo method is used to save computation time and to approximate the answers to the question.

Discussion:
In the transaction of 25 cents, Monte Carlo method can reach one decimal place of precision compared to the answers in the numerical approach when the sampling number is up to 10^5. Two decimal places of precision can be reached when the sampling number is up to 10^6. Thus we can observe a trade-off between computation time and precision of the answers.
